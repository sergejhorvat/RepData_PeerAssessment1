## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r ,echo = TRUE}
data <- unzip(zipfile = "activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv(data)
#class(activity)
activity <- activity[complete.cases(activity),] 

```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r ,echo = TRUE }
head(activity)




activityAgg <- aggregate(activity$steps~activity$date, activity,sum)


hist(x = activityAgg$`activity$steps`)

activityAggMean <- mean(activityAgg$`activity$steps`)
activityAggMean

median(activityAgg$`activity$steps`)

```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
